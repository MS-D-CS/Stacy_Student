            <h2>Welcome to my classroom</h2>
            <p>This is a sample portfolio website for my Web Development class being taught at CMR during the Spring of 2022.  In this class, students learn how to build beautiful, interactive websites by learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” three common coding languages on which all modern websites are built.  </p>
            <p>HTML is the foundation behind all web pages. It's used to add structure and form to text, images, and more. </p>
            <p> CSS is the stylesheet language a page is styled with, to tell browsers to change the color, font, layout, and more. </p>
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented computer programming language used to create interactivity within web browsers.  In this course, students learn the fundamentals of these three languages so that they can create visually appealing and interactive web pages.  This is a useful and lucrative skill to acquire as it used by nearly every single business in the world that needs a website to communicate to its customers. By the end of this class, expect to have all the skills required to build websites or even start a career with one of the thousands of companies that have a website. </p>
