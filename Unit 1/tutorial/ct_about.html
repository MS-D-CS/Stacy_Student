               <strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
               North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
               years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
               that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
               with our modern mobile food truck.
